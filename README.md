Pass in the API Key from profile (super easy to get to on settings page of todoist web, integrations tab).

Also stored in file locally. ex: `.\sync.py (Get-Content -raw .\apitok.secret).Trim()`

Currently hard coded to one project of mine...

TODO
- Add JSON/YAML file of projects and their files to sync
- Add code for that :)
